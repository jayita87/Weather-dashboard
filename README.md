# Weather-dashboard
## Description

The project is about learning how to invoke third party API's and use the data fetched from the third party API's and use that data to create a dashboard. In this dashboard I have called open weather third party API to get current and  5 day forecast data and have used that data to create weather dashboard. This app uses moment.js to use date and time.

Third Party API used in this project - https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api
